# i miss cats

The last landing pod was ready. Eight seats for the last eight travelers. The trip had been long, a centuries-long dreamless sleep for a thousand human refugees. The nuclear reactor and main computer had guided the colony ship through hundreds of light years of dead space, searching for a compatible world. A skeleton crew had been awoken as needed and spent short, tortured lives resolving desperate catastrophes.

The ship finally found a suitable planet; a long sought new home for this small, optimistic branch of humanity.

The ship itself was mostly cannabalized in the landing process. All that remained was a brittle spider of steel dwafing a tiny radioactive abdomen. One last landing pod dangled off the tip of an aluminum fang.

Eight seats for the last eight travelers. Seven were seated and waiting impatiently for the fall home.

I paused.

My seat looked comfortable, the straps strong. I looked back down the hallway, towards the leaking reactor, the remnants of the computer, almost certain death, and the tatters of a "hang in there kitty" poster.

"Take your seat, it's time."

I stopped.

"No, sir, I'm going back."

"Back? But why?"

The door closed. The pod slowly dipped down, my seat forever empty. I couldn't answer until the pod was out of view.

"I miss cats"

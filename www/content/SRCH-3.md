I floated silently down hallway "B".

This path was much shorter than the other hallways, and had a sturdy construction. The flexible segments were replaced by long branches of metal, spiraling around the hallway and interwined like the roots of an oak tree. Looking closer, each metal strut was a hollow tube, and it's surface was full of hexagonal holes, like a honeycomb.

The end of the hallway came soon, and explained the need for all the strengh. The hallway opened into a small booth, with windows overlooking another ball-shaped room, larger than the habitat pod. This must be the engine room.

The booth had few control panels and a paper manual attached to the wall. Through the window I could make out a device of twisted pipes and cables, suspended in the center of the engine ball by cables. The ball's surface had portholes across one hemisphere, and thick cables running up to the strange contraption in the middle.

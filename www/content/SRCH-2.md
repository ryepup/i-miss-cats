I floated silently down hallway "A".

The hallway was similar to the launch bay hallway, but this one seems longer. One major feature of the hallway is a large bundle of cables loosely attached to the wall with straps. The bundle was a cylinder about the size of my torso, snaking it's way towards the habitat ball.

The further I went, the narrower it got; near the end the thick cable took up almost half the space, and I was barely able to squeeze through. The hallway ended in a very small room with several crowded consoles. Like the habitat ball, anything that was easy to take had been taken, save another thick manual.

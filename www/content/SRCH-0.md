I looked around the launch bay. Without the dropship, it's just an empty metal donut with a hallway leading upwards toward's the habitat ball.

The dim hallway is segmented into a few long plastic cylinders, with LEDs showing the way and straps to help people navigate in low gravity. There's some trash and broken machinery scattered about; victims of the colonists rush to get out. The planet below adds a small tug, but we're effectively weightless.

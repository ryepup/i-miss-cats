I floated up the hallway into the cramped habitat ball.

Like the launch bay, the habitat ball has been stripped of most equipment. The walls are covered in a grid of hook-and-loop strips, mostly empty save a few hefty printed manuals.

The lack of gravity robbed me of any notion of "up" or "down". The spherical chamber had 6 openings, all aligned along one latitude drawn as a yellow stripe around the room. I considered that my equator. Most of the doors are sealed, but two hallways are open for more exploration; they are marked "A" and "B".

One of the poles was painted in blue and dominated by a large container overflowing with wires and loose connections. This was probably the computer core.

The other pole was decorated with red, with a sleeping bag strapped to the wall and an empty alcove with some more connectors hanging loose. I guess this was for eating and sleeping.
